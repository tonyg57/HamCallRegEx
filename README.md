# HamCallRegEx

Regular expression for U.S. amateur radio callsigns.

* Credit to GitHub user JoshuaCarroll as I tweaked his RegEx expression.

I use my expression in a MS Access query to identify U.S. only DMR IDs from the master world-wide DMR ID database.
It's also useful for filtering out bad U.S. calls that somehow missed scrutiny in the master DMR ID database.
